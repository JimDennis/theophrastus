Theophrastus: Simple Form and DB Handling in Bottle
===================================================

Theophrastus is a toy application for learning "full stack" web
programming.  It uses Python, Bottle, and SQLite3 in the most
minimal application I can write that does anything "meaningful."

I picked the name be scanning through the Google search results
and the Wikipedia article for 
[Message_in_a_bottle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_in_a_bottle)
where there's an unreliably sourced claim that Theophrastus released
the "first recorded messages in bottle." (Let me know if you ever find
a reliable citation supporting or refuting that claim).

The program, `simple_form.py`, simply presents a list of currently
active "notices" and a link through which you can post new ones. 
It keeps them in a simple database and you have the option to "close"
each one.  It will automatically re-create its database table if one
isn't found.

It currently comes with an almost equally dinky test utility called
`posttest.py` which posts 1000 messages to `simple_form.py` based
on sentences generated by the `loremipsum` Python module and times
the process. On my system it does about 60 posts per second.

`simple_form.py` depends only on [bottle](http://bottlepy.org/) since
[SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) is included in Python's standard
libraries.

`posttest.py` depends on Python [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
and [loremipsum](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/loremipsum/).
